This is core of React video platform application without static and webpack configurations.

We used symbiosis of [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), [Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) and [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) here.

Main idea was fast UI, where user can switch between lists of videos like Netflix do.
[video-react](https://video-react.js.org/) was used as a main video player and [react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick) for video previews sliding.

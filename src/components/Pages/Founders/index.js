                    Born and raised in Paris, France, Vanel took up magic at a young age to
                    overcome his shyness and found himself drawn to card tricks. His father
                    who is a doctor, showed him a few simple tricks and Vanel started out
                    performing visual tricks and manipulations, then soon enough
                    developing his own techniques amd starting own show {'"Magic of Paris"'}
